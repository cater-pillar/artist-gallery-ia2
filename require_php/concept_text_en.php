    <p>
        Drawings ORGANISM #1 are based on introspective narration and intimate visualisation of pain. Starting from the personal experience of recent past during a common cold, or a flu, I remember and reconstruct the feeling of pain. Common cold with cough thought about through drawing receives a visual shape as an imaginary or pseudo-medical report.  Pain is shown through seven drawing - the seven days of desease, shaped as a medical atlas.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the cold I was keeping a short diary where I regularly wrote about how I feel and described the physiological state of the organism. Based on these note I created the drawings and the text that accompanies them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Drawings represent a memory of a pain, a visual variation of a moment, medical visualisation and a form of disease that belong to imagination, although they are based on an actual state of being. Drawing were not created as an illustration of a scientific work, so the anatomical representation of body and disease, as well as the text that accompanies them, don't need to be precise.
    </p>
    <p>
        Medical elements I used and developed in my work show personal perception of human physiology. Besides the pain, the work also examines the state of isolation and self-isolation which often go along the desease. Here I don't just mean the gesture required as part of the healing process, but also the mental state of the diseased, the anxiety one might feel as he faces the processes of bodily degradation.
    </p>
    <p>
        The sound of long noise adds to the feeling of anxiety. The aim is to make the feeling of anxiety external, not just internal. External anxiety that the viewer experiences as he enters the organism.
    </p>
    <p>
        Drawing and the breathing sound represent the penetration into the organism, entering into the body, for which a small gallery space is of extreme importance. Confinement of the space, sound and visual content can create the effect of psychosomatic reaction within the viewer: the change of hearth tempo, destabilisation of blood pressure, changes in breathing pattern that illustrte the breathing sound one can hear in the surrounding space. Ideal conditions for a successful installation of the exhibition and the creation of the desired effect until now I only had in Shock Gallery of Art Clinic in Novi Sad.

    $concept2 = "<h2>ALTAR FOR DERMATITIS -Scarred Paintings about Scars-</h2>
    <p>
        Paintings or, more precisely, drawings on canvas 'Altar for Dermatitis' form a triptych and are based on personal experience of pain. Pain is source of horror for every individual and civilisation, and it is, at the same time, their parent. The archetype of pain appears in art over and over again. Visual solution may defer, but the essence of pain remains the same. I wanted to represent my constant inspiration, the experience of pain, through a medical drawing inspired by Ottoman medical illustration and the aesthetic of Far Est. The drawing 'Altar for Dermatitis' is a memory of a pain and thus, it is distorted and surreal.
    </p>
    <p>
        By documenting my health conditions and situations I have been through, I create a drawing on a canvas with visual poetics similar to Ottoman illuminated manuscripts for medical books of Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu and to Japanese prints. Didactic content of Ottoman medical drawings aimed at teaching the doctor how he should treat a patient, about the physical positioning of doctor in relation to the patient during the medical intervention is present on my drawings as well. Here, the main focus is not to represent the body anatomically, nor to visualise the skin disease itself, but rather, the focus is on the relation of patient toward a disease, on the self-isolation and search for healing, on the doctor-patient encounter, on the acceptance of disease itself. The analysis of disease through three stage, where the third one is on the verge of initiation, a rebirth through acceptance. White clear greyhound licking a hand is a Biblical scene about the lepers. However, unlike the dog that approaches the leper, accepts him and heals him, or they become outcasts together, I give my dog the role of pharmacy, of dermatology, which has no solutions for some conditions, but instead only offers plenty of medical preparations. The drawing represent a moment of realisation that there is no cure for dermatitis and, ironically, the only real healing is to accept the chronic condition. Putting on a mask received from the doctor is merely a gesture that symbolises a range of measures necessary only to hide the disease, not to cure it for real. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The cave, due to its secrecy, unavailability and darkness symbolises sanctuary for the diseased, where he hides from the eyes of the public. Likewise, it is a womb from which the disease will bi reborn with a mask on its face, that is to say, he will become acceptable to others and to himself, without the fear of becoming an outcast. The rainbow, as a symbol of hope and light points out to the optimism of the diseased, to his self acceptance. The white clear greyhound symbolises the pharmacological industry. It appears shy while creeping up to us, it licks our hand, but then it bites it off.

        The triptych 'Altar for Dermatitis' was damaged due to unfortunate circumstances. All three drawing are damaged in the lower corner, which prompted me to call my drawings 'scarred'.

    $concept3 = "<h2>„COLORFUL BOOKS“ -Visual diaries-</h2>
    <p>
        „COLORFUL BOOKS“ is a series of visual diaries under a single name created in the period from 2010 to 2019. They have been drawn in different cities: Novi Sad, Smederevo, Istanbul and Belgrade, while geographic and cultural distinctions of these locations influenced the visual style and symbolics. Every location represents a moment in life, decisions and interests of personal importance. Drawings are based on introspective narration and intimate visualisation of body and spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Time lapse from the first to the last diary represents gradual development and changes in visual expression. Different influences and interest take each others place. Gathered knowledge in art history, with special emphasis on Islamic miniature and medical books that drew my attention after my first 'medical' drawings had the biggest influence on my work. This influence developed further and my search expanded to Far Est, and beyond to contemporary representations of human physiology.
    </p>
    <p>
        Narrative built around the history and culture of Istanbul, with emphasis on miniatures, created a dynamic color palette and symbolics leaning toward mythological sceneries. These mythological sceneries are, in effect, real events I witnessed and which I represent through the perspective of miniatures. Diaries from Smederevo are a collection of personal desires and aspirations, fever dreams. Belgrade diary is socially engaged, where drawing and texts take the form of slogans and relate events happening during summer-spring 2018-19.

        On the pages of book on Aztec astrology I intervene in order to change the textual and visual form of the book. The book changes its form and meaning and becomes a Black Dog. This is a play on words and pictures within the book that are transformed through drawing interventions and turn a corny text into a surreal narration. This approach to drawing has a potential for further development, while the choice of a book as a basis holds key significance since the text it includes is of paramount significance for the transformation it will inspire. By letting the text and illustrations in the book on Aztec astrology to lead my interventions I reached the Black Dog. My intervention and textual manipulation is possible to the extent in which the pre-existing text allows it. My attempt to use a second book from the same edition for a completely different project proved to be almost impossible. The time elapsed until I moved on to the second book was not helpful, while bad, unimaginative text is almost identical in both books and provided more or less the same results. Consequently, The Black Dog and The Flower are, in a sense, visual twins.
