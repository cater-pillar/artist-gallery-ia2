# Website Portfolio

This is a website portfolio for artist Ivana Arandjelovic.

The website uses MySQL database to store different art projects including project name in English and Serbian, path to project cover photo, as wall as paths to individual images and descriptions for each photo. Slide show and animations are implemented using JQuery.

To set up the gallery import ia2.sql file to localhost using phpMyAdmin and copy the project folder to xampp/htdocs (for XAMPP users). Then adjust connection information in conn.php.
